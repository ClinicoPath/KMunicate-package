The goal of {KMunicate} is to produce Kaplan–Meier plots in the style recommended following the [KMunicate study](http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-030215) (TP Morris *et al*. Proposals on Kaplan–Meier plots in medical research and a survey of stakeholder views: KMunicate. *BMJ Open*, 2019, 9:e030215). 

## Installation

You can install {KMunicate} from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ellessenne/KMunicate-package")
```

## Example

```{r packages}
library(survival)
library(KMunicate)
```

The {KMunicate} package comes with a couple of bundled dataset, `cancer` and `brcancer`.
The main function is named `KMunicate`:

```{r brcancer, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7 / sqrt(2)}
KM <- survfit(Surv(rectime, censrec) ~ hormon, data = brcancer)
time_scale <- seq(0, max(brcancer$rectime), by = 365)
KMunicate(fit = KM, time_scale = time_scale)
```

```{r cancer, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7 / sqrt(2)}
KM <- survfit(Surv(studytime, died) ~ drug, data = cancer2)
time_scale <- seq(0, max(cancer2$studytime), by = 7)
KMunicate(fit = KM, time_scale = time_scale)
```

You also might wonder, does this work with a single arm?
Yes, yes it does:

```{r cancer-single, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 6}
KM <- survfit(Surv(studytime, died) ~ 1, data = cancer2)
time_scale <- seq(0, max(cancer2$studytime), by = 7)
KMunicate(fit = KM, time_scale = time_scale)
```

## Custom Fonts

Assuming you have set up your computer to use custom fonts with `ggplot2`, customising your KMunicate-style plot is trivial.
All you have to do is pass the font name as the `.ff` argument:

```{r cancer-single-ff, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 6}
KM <- survfit(Surv(studytime, died) ~ 1, data = cancer2)
time_scale <- seq(0, max(cancer2$studytime), by = 7)
KMunicate(fit = KM, time_scale = time_scale, .ff = "Victor Mono")
```
